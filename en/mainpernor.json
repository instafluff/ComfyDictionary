{"word":"mainpernor","definition":"A surety, under the old writ of mainprise, for a prisoner's appearance in court at a day. Note: Mainpernors differ from bail in that a man's bail may imprison or surrender him before the stipulated day of appearance; mainpernors can do neither; they are bound to produce him to answer all charges whatsoever. Blackstone."}
