{"word":"refutation","definition":"The act or process of refuting or disproving, or the state of being refuted; proof of falsehood or error; the overthrowing of an argument, opinion, testimony, doctrine, or theory, by argument or countervailing proof. Same of his blunders seem rather to deserve a flogging than a refutation. Macaulay."}
