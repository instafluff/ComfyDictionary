{"word":"linear","definition":"1. Of or pertaining to a line; consisting of lines; in a straight direction; lineal. 2. (Bot.)  Like a line; narrow; of the same breadth throughout, except at the extremities; as, a linear leaf. Linear differential (Math.), an equation which is of the first degree, when the expression which is equated to zero is regarded as a function of the dependent variable and its differential coefficients. -- Linear equation (Math.), an equation of the first degree between two variables; -- so called because every such equation may be considered as representing a right line. -- Linear measure, the measurement of length. -- Linear numbers (Math.), such numbers as have relation to length only: such is a number which represents one side of a plane figure. If the plane figure is square, the linear figure is called a root. -- Linear problem (Geom.), a problem which may be solved geometrically by the use of right lines alone. -- Linear transformation (Alg.), a change of variables where each variable is replaced by a function of the first degree in the new variable."}
