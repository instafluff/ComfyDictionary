{"word":"tenure","definition":"1. The act or right of holding, as property, especially real estate. That the tenure of estates might rest on equity, the Indian title to lands was in all cases to be quieted. Bancroft. 2. (Eng. Law)  The manner of holding lands and tenements of a superior. Note: Tenure is inseparable from the idea of property in land, according to the theory of the English law; and this idea of tenure pervades, to a considerable extent, the law of real property in the United States, where the title to land is essentially allodial, and almost all lands are held in fee simple, not of a superior, but the whole right and title to the property being vested in the owner. Tenure, in general, then, is the particular manner of holding real estate, as by exclusive title or ownership, by fee simple, by fee tail, by courtesy, in dower, by copyhold, by lease, at will, etc. 3. The consideration, condition, or service which the occupier of land gives to his lord or superior for the use of his land. 4. Manner of holding, in general; as, in absolute governments, men hold their rights by a precarious tenure. All that seems thine own, Held by the tenure of his will alone. Cowper. Tenure by fee alms. (Law) See Frankalmoigne."}
