{"word":"oriel","definition":"1. A gallery for minstrels. [Obs.] W. Hamper. 2. A small apartment next a hall, where certain persons were accustomed to dine; a sort of recess. [Obs.] Cowell. 3. (Arch.)  A bay window. See Bay window. The beams that thro' the oriel shine Make prisms in every carven glass. Tennyson.

In the United States the latter name is often applied to bay windows which are small, and either polygonal or round; also, to such as are corbeled out from the wall instead of resting on the ground."}
