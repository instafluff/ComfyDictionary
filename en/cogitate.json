{"word":"cogitate","definition":"To engage in continuous thought; to think. He that calleth a thing into his mind, whether by impression or recordation, cogitateth and considereth, and he that employeth the faculty of his fancy also cogitateth. Bacon.\n\nTo think over; to plan. He . . . is our witness, how we both day and night, revolving in our minds, did cogitate nothing more than how to satisfy the parts of a good pastor. Foxe."}
