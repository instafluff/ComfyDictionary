{"word":"postulate","definition":"1. Something demanded or asserted; especially, a position or supposition assumed without proof, or one which is considered as self-evident; a truth to which assent may be demanded or challenged, without argument or evidence. 2. (Geom.)  The enunciation of a self-evident problem, in distinction from an axiom, which is the enunciation of a self-evident theorem. The distinction between a postulate and an axiom lies in this, -- that the latter is admitted to be self-evident, while the former may be agreed upon between two reasoners, and admitted by both, but not as proposition which it would be impossible to deny. Eng. Cyc.\n\nPostulated. [Obs.] Hudibras.\n\n1. To beg, or assume without proof; as, to postulate conclusions. 2. To take without express consent; to assume. The Byzantine emperors appear to have . . . postulated a sort of paramount supremacy over this nation. W. Tooke. 3. To invite earnestly; to solicit. [Obs.] Bp. Burnet."}
