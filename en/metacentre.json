{"word":"metacentre","definition":"The point of intersection of a vertical line through the center of gravity of the fluid displaced by a floating body which is tipped through a small angle from its position of equilibrium, and the inclined line which was vertical through the center of gravity of the body when in equilibrium. Note: When the metacenter is above the center of gravity, the position of the body is stable; when below it, unstable."}
