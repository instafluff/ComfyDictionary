{"word":"mare","definition":"The female of the horse and other equine quadrupeds.\n\nSighing, suffocative panting, intercepted utterance, with a sense of pressure across the chest, occurring during sleep; the incubus; -- obsolete, except in the compound nightmare. I will ride thee o' nights like the mare. Shak."}
