{"word":"deodand","definition":"A personal chattel which had caused the death of a person, and for that reason was given to God, that is, forfeited to the crown, to be applied to pious uses, and distributed in alms by the high almoner. Thus, if a cart ran over a man and killed him, it was forfeited as a deodand. Note: Deodands are unknown in American law, and in 1846 were abolished in England."}
