{"word":"ample","definition":"Large; great in size, extent, capacity, or bulk; spacious; roomy; widely extended. All the people in that ample house Did to that image bow their humble knees. Spenser. 2. Fully sufficient; abundant; liberal; copious; as, an ample fortune; ample justice. 3. Not contracted of brief; not concise; extended; diffusive; as, an ample narrative. Johnson. Syn. -- Full; spacious; extensive; wide; capacious; abundant; plentiful; plenteous; copious; bountiful; rich; liberal; munificent. -- Ample, Copious, Abundant, Plenteous. These words agree in representing a thing as large, but under different relations, according to the image which is used. Ample implies largeness, producing a sufficiency or fullness of supply for every want; as, ample stores or resources, ample provision. Copious carries with it the idea of flow, or of collection at a single point; as, a copious supply of materials. \"Copious matter of my song.\" Milton. Abundant and plenteous refer to largeness of quantity; as, abundant stores; plenteous harvests."}
