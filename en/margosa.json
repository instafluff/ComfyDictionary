{"word":"margosa","definition":"A large tree of genus Melia (M. Azadirachta) found in India. Its bark is bitter, and used as a tonic. A valuable oil is expressed from its seeds, and a tenacious gum exudes from its trunk. The M. Azedarach is a much more showy tree, and is cultivated in the Southern United States, where it is known as Pride of India, Pride of China, or bead tree. Various parts of the tree are considered anthelmintic. The margosa oil . . . is a most valuable balsam for wounds, having a peculiar smell which prevents the attacks of flies. Sir S. Baker."}
