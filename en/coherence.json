{"word":"coherence","definition":"1. A sticking or cleaving together; union of parts of the same body; cohesion. 2. Connection or dependence, proceeding from the subordination of the parts of a thing to one principle or purpose, as in the parts of a discourse, or of a system of philosophy; consecutiveness. Coherence of discourse, and a direct tendency of all the parts of it to the argument in hand, are most eminently to be found in him. Locke."}
