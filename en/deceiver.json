{"word":"deceiver","definition":"One who deceives; one who leads into error; a cheat; an impostor. The deceived and the deceiver are his. Job xii. 16. Syn. -- Deceiver, Impostor. A deceiver operates by stealth and in private upon individuals; an impostor practices his arts on the community at large. The one succeeds by artful falsehoods, the other by bold assumption. The faithless friend and the fickle lover are deceivers; the false prophet and the pretended prince are impostors."}
