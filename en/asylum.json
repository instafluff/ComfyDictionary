So sacred was the church to some, that it had the right of an asylum or sanctuary. Ayliffe. Note: The name was anciently given to temples, altars, statues of the gods, and the like. In later times Christian churches were regarded as asylums in the same sense. 2. Any place of retreat and security. Earth has no other asylum for them than its own cold bosom. Southey. 3.
