{"word":"vase","definition":"1.

See Illust. of Niche. (b) The body, or naked ground, of the Corinthian and Composite capital; -- called also tambour, and drum. Note: Until the time of Walker (1791), vase was made to rhyme with base,, case, etc., and it is still commonly so pronounced in the United States. Walker made it to rhyme with phrase, maze, etc. Of modern English practice, Mr. A. J. Ellis (1874) says: \"Vase has four pronunciations in English: vasz, which I most commonly say, is going out of use väz I hear most frequently, vaz very rarely, and vas I only know from Cull's marking. On the analogy of case, however, it should be the regular sound.\" 3. (Bot.)  The calyx of a plant."}
