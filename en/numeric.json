{"word":"numeric","definition":"1. Belonging to number; denoting number; consisting in numbers; expressed by numbers, and not letters; as, numerical characters; a numerical equation; a numerical statement. Note: Numerical, as opposed to algebraical, is used to denote a value irrespective of its sign; thus, -5 is numerically greater than -3, though algebraically less. 2.2. The same in number; hence, identically the same; identical; as, the same numerical body. [Obs.] South. Would to God that all my fellow brethren, which with me bemoan the loss of their books, . . . might rejoice for the recovery thereof, though not the same numerical volumes. Fuller. Numerical equation (Alg.), an equation which has all the quantities except the unknown expressed in numbers; -- distinguished from literal equation. -- Numerical value of an equation or expression, that deduced by substituting numbers for the letters, and reducing.\n\nAny number, proper or improper fraction, or incommensurable ratio. The term also includes any imaginary expression like m + nsq. root-1, where m and n are real numerics."}
