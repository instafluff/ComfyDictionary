{"word":"theorem","definition":"1. That which is considered and established as a principle; hence, sometimes, a rule. Not theories, but theorems (Coleridge. By the theorems, Which your polite and terser gallants practice, I re-refine the court, and civilize Their barbarous natures. Massinger. 2. (Math.)  A statement of a principle to be demonstrated. Note: A theorem is something to be proved, and is thus distinguished from a problem, which is something to be solved. In analysis, the term is sometimes applied to a rule, especially a rule or statement of relations expressed in a formula or by symbols; as, the binomial theorem; Taylor's theorem. See the Note under Proposition, n., 5. Binomial theorem. (Math.) See under Binomial. -- Negative theorem, a theorem which expresses the impossibility of any assertion. -- Particular theorem (Math.), a theorem which extends only to a particular quantity. -- Theorem of Pappus.
