{"word":"osmose","definition":"(a) The tendency in fluids to mix, or become equably diffused, when in contact. It was first observed between fluids of differing densities, and as taking place through a membrane or an intervening porous structure. The more rapid flow from the thinner to the thicker fluid was then called endosmose, and the opposite, slower current, exosmose. Both are, however, results of the same force. Osmose may be regarded as a form of molecular attraction, allied to that of adhesion. (b) The action produced by this tendency. Electric osmose, or Electric endosmose (Elec.), the transportation of a liquid through a porous septum by the action of an electric current."}
