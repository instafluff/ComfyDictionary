What is voluntary is the result of a volition, or act of choice; it therefore implies some degree of consideration, and may be the result of mere reason without excited feeling.

Hence, the term is also applied to things inanimate when they are produced without the determinate purpose or care of man. \"Abstinence which is but voluntary fasting, and . . . exercise which is but voluntary labor.\" J.
