{"word":"hemisystole","definition":"Contraction of only one ventricle of the heart. Note: Hemisystole is noticed in rare cases of insufficiency of the mitral valve, in which both ventricles at times contract simultaneously, as in a normal heart, this condition alternating with contraction of the right ventricle alone; hence, intermittent hemisystole."}
