{"word":"republication","definition":"A second publication, or a new publication of something before published, as of a former will, of a volume already published, or the like; specifically, the publication in one country of a work first issued in another; a reprint. If there be many testaments, the last overthrows all the former; but the republication of a former will revokes one of a later date, and establishes the first. Blackstone."}
