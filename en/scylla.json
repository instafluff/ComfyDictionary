{"word":"scylla","definition":"A dangerous rock on the Italian coast opposite the whirpool Charybdis on the coast of Sicily, -- both personified in classical literature as ravenous monsters. The passage between them was formerly considered perilous; hence, the saying \"Between Scylla and Charybdis,\" signifying a great peril on either hand."}
