{"word":"expect","definition":"1. To wait for; to await. [Obs.] Let's in, and there expect their coming. Shak. 2. To look for (mentally); to look forward to, as to something that is believed to be about to happen or come; to have a previous apprehension of, whether of good or evil; to look for with some confidence; to anticipate; -- often followed by an infinitive, sometimes by a clause (with, or without, that); as I expect to receive wages; I expect that the troops will be defeated. \"Good: I will expect you.\" Shak. \"Expecting thy reply.\" Shak. The Somersetshire or yellow regiment . . . was expected to arrive on the following day. Macaulay. Syn. -- To anticipate; look for; await; hope. -- To Expect, Think, Believe, Await. Expect is a mental act and has aways a reference to the future, to some coming event; as a person expects to die, or he expects to survive. Think and believe have reference to the past and present, as well as to the future; as I think the mail has arrived; I believe he came home yesterday, that he is he is at home now. There is a not uncommon use of expect, which is a confusion of the two; as, I expect the mail has arrived; I expect he is at home. This misuse should be avoided. Await is a physical or moral act. We await that which, when it comes, will affect us personally. We expect what may, or may not, interest us personally. See Anticipate.\n\nTo wait; to stay. [Obs.] Sandys.\n\nExpectation. [Obs.] Shak."}
