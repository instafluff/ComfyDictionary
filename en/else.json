{"word":"else","definition":"Other; one or something beside; as, Who else is coming What else shall I give Do you expect anything else \"Bastards and else.\" Shak. Note: This word always follows its noun. It is usual to give the possessive form to else rather than to the substantive; as, somebody else's; no one else's. \"A boy who is fond of somebody else's pencil case.\" G. Eliot. \"A suit of clothes like everybody else's.\" Thackeray.\n\n1. Besides; except that mentioned; in addition; as, nowhere else; no one else. 2. Otherwise; in the other, or the contrary, case; if the facts were different. For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it. Ps. li. 16. Note: After `or', else is sometimes used expletively, as simply noting an alternative. \"Will you give thanks, . . . or else shall I\" Shak."}
