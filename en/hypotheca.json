{"word":"hypotheca","definition":"An obligation by which property of a debtor was made over to his creditor in security of his debt. Note: It differed from pledge in regard to possession of the property subject to the obligation; pledge requiring, simple hypotheca not requiring, possession of it by the creditor. The modern mortgage corresponds very closely with it. Kent."}
