{"word":"coshering","definition":"A feudal prerogative of the lord of the soil entitling him to lodging and food at his tenant's house. Burrill. Sometimes he contrived, in deflance of the law, to live by coshering, that is to say, by quartering himself on the old tentants of his family, who, wretched as was their own condition, could not refuse a portion of their pittance to one whom they still regarded as their rightful lord. Macaulay."}
