{"word":"insert","definition":"To set within something; to put or thrust in; to introduce; to cause to enter, or be included, or contained; as, to insert a scion in a stock; to insert a letter, word, or passage in a composition; to insert an advertisement in a newspaper. These words were very weakly inserted where they will be so liable to misconstruction. Bp. Stillingfleet."}
