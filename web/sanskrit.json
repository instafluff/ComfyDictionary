{"word":"sanskrit","definition":"The ancient language of the Hindoos, long since obsolete in vernacular use, but preserved to the present day as the literary and sacred dialect of India. It is nearly allied to the Persian, and to the principal languages of Europe, classical and modern, and by its more perfect preservation of the roots and forms of the primitive language from which they are all descended, is a most important assistance in determining their history and relations. Cf. Prakrit, and Veda.\n\nOf or pertaining to Sanskrit; written in Sanskrit; as, a Sanskrit dictionary or inscription."}
