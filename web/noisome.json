{"word":"noisome","definition":"1. Noxious to health; hurtful; mischievous; unwholesome; insalubrious; destructive; as, noisome effluvia. \"Noisome pestilence.\" Ps. xci. 3. 2. Offensive to the smell or other senses; disgusting; fetid. \"Foul breath is noisome.\" Shak. -- Noi\"some*ly, adv. -- Noi\"some*ness, n. Syn. -- Noxious; unwholesome; insalubrious; mischievous; destructive. -- Noisome, Noxious. These words have to a great extent been interchanged; but there is a tendency to make a distinction between them, applying noxious to things that inflict evil directly; as, a noxious plant, noxious practices, etc., and noisome to things that operate with a remoter influence; as, noisome vapors, a noisome pestilence, etc. Noisome has the additional sense of disqusting. A garden may be free from noxious weeds or animals; but, if recently covered with manure, it may be filled with a noisome smell."}
