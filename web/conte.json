{"word":"conte","definition":"A short narrative or tale, esp. one dealing with surprising or marvelous events. The conte (sic) is a tale something more than a sketch, it may be, and something less than a short story. . . . The \"Canterbury Tales\" are contes, most of them, if not all, and so are some of the \"Tales of a Wayside Inn.\" Brander Matthews."}
