{"word":"generalize","definition":"1. To bring under a genus or under genera; to view in relation to a genus or to genera. Copernicus generalized the celestial motions by merely referring them to the moon's motion. Newton generalized them still more by referring this last to the motion of a stone through the air. W. Nicholson. 2. To apply to other genera or classes; to use with a more extensive application; to extend so as to include all special cases; to make universal in application, as a formula or rule. When a fact is generalized, our discontent is quited, and we consider the generality itself as tantamount to an explanation. Sir W. Hamilton. 3. To derive or deduce (a general conception, or a general principle) from particulars. A mere conclusion generalized from a great multitude of facts. Coleridge.\n\nTo form into a genus; to view objects in their relations to a genus or class; to take general or comprehensive views."}
