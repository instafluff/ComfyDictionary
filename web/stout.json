{"word":"stout","definition":"1. Strong; lusty; vigorous; robust; sinewy; muscular; hence, firm; resolute; dauntless. With hearts stern and stout. Chaucer. A stouter champion never handled sword. Shak. He lost the character of a bold, stout, magnanimous man. Clarendon. The lords all stand To clear their cause, most resolutely stout. Daniel. 2. Proud; haughty; arrogant; hard.

Firm; tough; materially strong; enduring; as, a stout vessel, stick, string, or cloth. 4. Large; bulky; corpulent. Syn. -- Stout, Corpulent, Portly. Corpulent has reference simply to a superabundance or excess of flesh. Portly implies a kind of stoutness or corpulence which gives a dignified or imposing appearance. Stout, in our early writers (as in the English Bible), was used chiefly or wholly in the sense of strong or bold; as, a stout champion; a stout heart; a stout resistance, etc. At a later period it was used for thickset or bulky, and more recently, especially in England, the idea has been carried still further, so that Taylor says in his Synonyms: \"The stout man has the proportions of an ox; he is corpulent, fat, and fleshy in relation to his size.\" In America, stout is still commonly used in the original sense of strong as, a stout boy; a stout pole.\n\nA strong malt liquor; strong porter. Swift."}
