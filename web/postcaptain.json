{"word":"post-captain","definition":"A captain of a war vessel whose name appeared, or was \"posted,\" in the seniority list of the British navy, as distinguished from a commander whose name was not so posted. The term was also used in the United States navy; but no such commission as post-captain was ever recognized in either service, and the term has fallen into disuse."}
