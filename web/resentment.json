Anger is the broader term, denoting a keen sense of disapprobation (usually with a desire to punish) for watever we feel to be wrong, whether directed toward ourselves or others. Reseniment is anger exicted by a sense of personal injury. It is, etymologically, that reaction of the mind which we instinctively feel when we think ourselves wronged. Pride and selfishness are apt to aggravate this feeling until it changes into a criminal animosity; and this is now the more common signification of the term. Being founded in a sense of injury, this feeling is hard to be removed; and hence the expressions bitter or implacable resentment. See Anger. Anger is like A full-hot horse, who being allowed his way, Self- mettle tires him. Shak. Can heavently minds such high resentment show, Or exercise their spite in human woe Dryden."}
