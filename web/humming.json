They feed both upon the nectar of flowers and upon small insects. The common humming bird or ruby-throat of the Eastern United States is Trochilus culubris. Several other species are found in the Western United States. See Calliope, and Ruby-throat. -- Humming-bird moth (Zoöl.), a hawk moth. See Hawk moth, under Hawk, the bird."}
