{"word":"etch","definition":"A variant of Eddish. [Obs.] Mortimer.\n\n1. To produce, as figures or designs, on mental, glass, or the like, by means of lines or strokes eaten in or corroded by means of some strong acid. Note: The plate is first covered with varnish, or some other ground capable of resisting the acid, and this is then scored or scratched with a needle, or similar instrument, so as to form the drawing; the plate is then covered with acid, which corrodes the metal in the lines thus laid bare. 2. To subject to etching; to draw upon and bite with acid, as a plate of metal. I was etching a plate at the beginning of 1875. Hamerton. 3. To sketch; to delineate. [R.] There are many empty terms to be found in some learned writes, to which they had recourse to etch out their system. Locke.\n\nTo practice etching; to make etchings."}
