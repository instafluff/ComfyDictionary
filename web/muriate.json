{"word":"muriate","definition":"A salt of muriatic hydrochloric acid; a chloride; as, muriate of ammonia. Note: This term, as also the word muriatic, was formerly applied to the chlorides before their true composition was understood, and while they were erroneously supposed to be compounds of an acid with an oxide. Muriate and muriatic are still occasionally used as commercial terms, but are obsolete in scientific language."}
