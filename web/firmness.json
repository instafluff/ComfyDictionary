{"word":"firmness","definition":"The state or quality of being firm. Syn. -- Firmness, Constancy. Firmness belongs to the will, and constancy to the affections and principles; the former prevents us from yielding, and the latter from fluctuating. Without firmness a man has no character; \"without constancy,\" says Addison, \"there is neither love, friendship, nor virtue in the world.\""}
