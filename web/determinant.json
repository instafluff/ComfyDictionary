{"word":"determinant","definition":"Serving to determine or limit; determinative.\n\n1. That which serves to determine; that which causes determination. 2. (Math.)  The sum of a series of products of several numbers, these products being formed according to certain specified laws; thus, the determinant of the nine numbers. a, b, c,a', b', c',a'\\'b7, b'\\'b7, c'\\'b7, is a b' c'\\'b7 -- a b'\\'b7 c' + a' b'\\'b7 c] -- a' b c'\\'b7 + a'\\'b7 b' c. The determinant is written by placing the numbers from which it is formed in a square between two vertical lines. The theory of determinants forms a very important branch of modern mathematics. 3. (Logic)  A mark or attribute, attached to the subject or predicate, narrowing the extent of both, but rendering them more definite and precise. Abp. Thomson."}
