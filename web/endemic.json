{"word":"endemic","definition":"Peculiar to a district or particular locality, or class of persons; as, an endemic disease. Note: An endemic disease is one which is constantly present to a greater or less degree in any place, as distinguished from an epidemic disease, which prevails widely at some one time, or periodically, and from a sporadic disease, of which a few instances occur now and then.\n\nAn endemic disease. Fear, which is an endemic latent in every human heart, sometimes rises into an epidemic. J. B. Heard."}
