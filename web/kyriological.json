{"word":"kyriological","definition":"Serving to denote objects by conventional signs or alphabetical characters; as, the original Greek alphabet of sixteen letters was called kyriologic, because it represented the pure elementary sounds. See Curiologic. [Written also curiologic and kuriologic.] Note: The term is also applied, as by Warburton, to those Egyptian hieroglyphics, in which a part is put conventionally for the whole, as in depicting a battle by two hands, one holding a shield and the other a bow."}
