{"word":"deism","definition":"The doctrine or creed of a deist; the belief or system of those who acknowledge the existence of one God, but deny revelation. Note: Deism is the belief in natural religion only, or those truths, in doctrine and practice, which man is to discover by the light of reason, independent of any revelation from God. Hence, deism implies infidelity, or a disbelief in the divine origin of the Scriptures."}
