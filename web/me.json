{"word":"me","definition":"One. See Men, pron. [Obs.] Chaucer.\n\nThe person speaking, regarded as an object; myself; a pronoun of the first person used as the objective and dative case of the pronoum I; as, he struck me; he gave me the money, or he gave the money to me; he got me a hat, or he got a hat for me. Note: In methinks, me is properly in the dative case, and the verb is impersonal, the construction being, it appears to me. In early use me was often placed before forms of the verb to be with an adjective; as, me were lief. Me rather had my heart might feel your love Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy. Shak."}
