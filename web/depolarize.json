{"word":"depolarize","definition":"1. (Opt.)  To deprive of polarity; to reduce to an unpolarized condition. Note: This word has been inaccurately applied in optics to describe the effect of a polarizing medium, as a crystalline plate, in causing the reappearance of a ray, in consequence of a change in its plane of polarization, which previously to the change was intercepted by the analyzer. 2. (Elec.)  To free from polarization, as the negative plate of the voltaic battery."}
