{"word":"you","definition":"The pronoun of the second person, in the nominative, dative, and objective case, indicating the person or persons addressed. See the Note under Ye. Ye go to Canterbury; God you speed. Chaucer. Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place. Shak. In vain you tell your parting lover You wish fair winds may waft him over. Prior. Note: Though you is properly a plural, it is in all ordinary discourse used also in addressing a single person, yet properly always with a plural verb. \"Are you he that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind is so admired \" Shak. You and your are sometimes used indefinitely, like we, they, one, to express persons not specified. \"The looks at a distance like a new-plowed land; but as you come near it, you see nothing but a long heap of heavy, disjointed clods.\" Addison. \"Your medalist and critic are much nearer related than the world imagine.\" Addison. \"It is always pleasant to be forced to do what you wish to do, but what, until pressed, you dare not attempt.\" Hook. You is often used reflexively for yourself of yourselves. \"Your highness shall repose you at the tower.\" Shak."}
