{"word":"moroseness","definition":"Sourness of temper; sulenness. Learn good humor, never to oppose without just reason; abate some degrees of pride and moroseness. I. Watts. Note: Moroseness is not precisely peevishness or fretfulness, though often accompained with it. It denotes more of silence and severity, or ill-humor, than the irritability or irritation which characterizes peevishness."}
