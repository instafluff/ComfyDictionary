{"word":"waive","definition":"1. A waif; a castaway. [Obs.] Donne. 2. (O. Eng. Law)  A woman put out of the protection of the law. See Waive, v. t., 3 (b), and the Note.\n\n1. To relinquish; to give up claim to; not to insist on or claim; to refuse; to forego. He waiveth milk, and flesh, and all. Chaucer. We absolutely do renounce or waive our own opinions, absolutely yielding to the direction of others. Barrow. 2. To throw away; to cast off; to reject; to desert. 3. (Law) (a) To throw away; to relinquish voluntarily, as a right which one may enforce if he chooses. (b) (O. Eng. Law)  To desert; to abandon. Burrill. Note: The term was applied to a woman, in the same sense as outlaw to a man. A woman could not be outlawed, in the proper sense of the word, because, according to Bracton, she was never in law, that is, in a frankpledge or decennary; but she might be waived, and held as abandoned. Burrill.\n\nTo turn aside; to recede. [Obs.] To waive from the word of Solomon. Chaucer."}
