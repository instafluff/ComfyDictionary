{"word":"whist","definition":"Be silent; be still; hush; silence.\n\nA certain game at cards; -- so called because it requires silence and close attention. It is played by four persons (those who sit opposite each other being partners) with a complete pack of fifty-two cards. Each player has thirteen cards, and when these are played out, he hand is finished, and the cards are again shuffled and distributed. Note: Points are scored for the tricks taken in excess of six, and for the honors held. In long whist, now seldom played, ten points make the game; in short whist, now usually played in England, five points make the game. In American whist, so-called, honors are not counted, and seven points by tricks make the game.\n\nTo hush or silence. [Obs.] Spenser.\n\nTo be or become silent or still; to be hushed or mute. [R.] Surrey.\n\nNot speaking; not making a noise; silent; mute; still; quiet. \"So whist and dead a silence.\" Sir J. Harrington. The winds, with wonder whist, Smoothly the waters kissed. Milton. Note: This adjective generally follows its noun, or is used predicatively."}
