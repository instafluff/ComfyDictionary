{"word":"manor","definition":"1. (Eng. Law)  The land belonging to a lord or nobleman, or so much land as a lord or great personage kept in his own hands, for the use and subsistence of his family. My manors, rents, revenues, l forego. Shak. Note: In these days, a manor rather signifies the jurisdiction and royalty incorporeal, than the land or site, for a man may have a manor in gross, as the law terms it, that is, the right and interest of a court-baron, with the perquisites thereto belonging. 2. (American Law)  A tract of land occupied by tenants who pay a free-farm rent to the proprietor, sometimes in kind, and sometimes by performing certain stipulated services. Burrill. Manor house, or Manor seat, the house belonging to a manor."}
