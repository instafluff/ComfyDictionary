Fealty was originally the fidelity of such a tenant to his lord, and hence the term denotes a faithful and solemn adherence to the obligations we owe to superior power or authority. We pay our homage to men of preëminent usefulness and virtue, and profess our fealty to the principles by which they have been guided. Go, go with homage yon proud victors meet ! Go, lie like dogs beneath your masters' feet ! Dryden. Man, disobeying, Disloyal, breaks his fealty, and sins Against the high supremacy of heaven. Milton.\n\n1.
