{"word":"phonography","definition":"1. A description of the laws of the human voice, or sounds uttered by the organs of speech. 2. A representation of sounds by distinctive characters; commonly, a system of shorthand writing invented by Isaac Pitman, or a modification of his system, much used by reporters. Note: The consonants are represented by straight lines and curves; the vowels by dots and short dashes; but by skilled phonographers, in rapid work, most vowel marks are omitted, and brief symbols for common words and combinations of words are extensively employed. The following line is an example of phonography, in which all the sounds are indicated: -- They also serve who only stand and wait. Milton. 3. The art of constructing, or using, the phonograph."}
