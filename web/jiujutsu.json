{"word":"jiujutsu","definition":"The Japanese art of self-defense without weapons, now widely used as a system of physical training. It depends for its efficiency largely upon the principle of making use of an opponent's strength and weight to disable or injure him, and by applying pressure so that his opposing movement will throw him out of balance, dislocate or break a joint, etc.  It opposes knowledge and skill to brute strength, and demands an extensive practical knowledge of human anatomy."}
