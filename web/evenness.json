{"word":"evenness","definition":"The state of being ven, level, or disturbed; smoothness; horizontal position; uniformity; impartiality; calmness; equanimity; appropriate place or level; as, evenness of surface, of a fluid at rest, of motion, of dealings, of temper, of condition. It had need be something extraordinary, that must warrant an ordinary person to rise higher than his own evenness. Jer. Taylor."}
