{"word":"divination","definition":"1. The act of divining; a foreseeing or foretelling of future events; the pretended art discovering secret or future by preternatural means.

Note: Among the ancient heathen philosophers natural divination was supposed to be effected by a divine afflatus; artificial divination by certain rites, omens, or appearances, as the flight of birds, entrails of animals, etc. 2. An indication of what is future or secret; augury omen; conjectural presage; prediction. Birds which do give a happy divination of things to come. Sir T. North."}
