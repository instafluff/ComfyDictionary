{"word":"apodosis","definition":"The consequent clause or conclusion in a conditional sentence, expressing the result, and thus distinguished from the protasis or clause which expresses a condition. Thus, in the sentence, \"Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him,\" the former clause is the protasis, and the latter the apodosis. Note: Some grammarians extend the terms protasis and apodosis to the introductory clause and the concluding clause, even when the sentence is not conditional."}
