{"word":"dynamic","definition":"1. Of or pertaining to dynamics; belonging to energy or power; characterized by energy or production of force. Science, as well as history, has its past to show, -- a past indeed, much larger; but its immensity is dynamic, not divine. J. Martineau. The vowel is produced by phonetic, not by dynamic, causes. J. Peile. 2. Relating to physical forces, effects, or laws; as, dynamical geology. As natural science has become more dynamic, so has history. Prof. Shedd. Dynamical electricity. See under Electricity."}
