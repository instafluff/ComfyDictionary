{"word":"axiom","definition":"1. (Logic & Math.)  A self-evident and necessary truth, or a proposition whose truth is so evident as first sight that no reasoning or demonstration can make it plainer; a proposition which it is necessary to take for granted; as, \"The whole is greater than a part;\" \"A thing can not, at the same time, be and not be.\" 2. An established principle in some art or science, which, though not a necessary truth, is universally received; as, the axioms of political economy. Syn. -- Axiom, Maxim, Aphorism, Adage. An axiom is a self-evident truth which is taken for granted as the basis of reasoning.
